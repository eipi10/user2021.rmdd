## Create shareable reports through packages

### You need to create a package with your functions

Then, two possible ways:

- Classical package: Use external projects to use your package functions in Rmd reports
- Compendium-like: Include the Rmd reports inside the package development project

## Combine {fusen} and {rcompendium}

The compendium logic is to separate code from the report output:

- One place to store your R scripts in "R/"
- One place to store the Rmarkdown report in "analyses/"

This is similar to package logic:

- One place to store R scripts in "R/"
- One place to store Rmarkdown examples of use in "vignettes/"

### Let's combine both worlds
